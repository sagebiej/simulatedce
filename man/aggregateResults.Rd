\item{designname}{A character vector of design names used in the simulation.}

\item{bcoeff}{A named list of true parameter values used in the simulation.}

\item{reshape_type}{Method for reshaping data: "auto", "stats", or "tidyr".}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Processes the simulation results to extract summaries, coefficients, and graphs.
